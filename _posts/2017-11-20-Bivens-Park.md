<b>Abstract:<b/> Photogrammetry is a valuable tool to enhance our understanding of our environment. Recently, modern technology and open-source software have made photogrammetry more affordable and statistically robust. With the advent of powerful consumer grade cameras, researchers can now pair their photogrammetric skills with innovative methods to elucidate textured objects in space. Skills employed in this study present data regarding tree spatial arrangement and shallow root architecture. Additionally, this analysis aims to present a comprehensive terrestrial method to accurately build a three-dimensional (3D) multi-view reconstruction of a felled tree. The model was created using a non-metric Sony a7S II E-mount camera with a full frame sensor (ILCE-7SM2). The tree is located at Bivens Arm Nature Park, 3650 S Main St., Gainesville, Florida, US. Agisoft PhotoScan Professional Ed., Version 1.2.0, is the software utilized in this analysis. Two concentric circles were created around the subject before the photogrammetric process began. For increased accuracy, a camera overlay of 60%-80% was implemented. The general method employed SfM (Structure-from-Motion) photogrammetry to capture the subject. During post-processing, additional metrics were recorded at an adjacent bench, which also exists in object space. The mean error recorded using Agisoft PhotoScan was 0.00100(m), while the total error of accuracy was 0.005296(m), or 0.5%. Since trees exist in a dynamic environment, accurately understanding their static scale and spatial arrangement allows researchers to statistically assess their likelihood of failure.
