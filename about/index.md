I'm a graduate student at the University of Florida, working towards a M.Sc., in Environmental Horticulture and a Minor: Geomatics. My Masters Thesis investigates: _Use of Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry to Accurately Model and Measure Mature Tree Root Systems_. Post-graduation, I will apply for a Ph.D./ DPM in Environmental Horticulture. In the future, I plan to work for an innovative agribusiness or geospatial firm.
